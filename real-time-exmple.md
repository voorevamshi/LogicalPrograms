# Java Data Structures â€“ Real World Examples

This document maps commonly used **Java Data Structures** to **real-time applications** for better understanding and interview preparation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Arrays
- **1D Array**
  - Storing marks of students.
  - Storing product IDs in an e-commerce cart.
- **2D Array**
  - **Bus ticket booking system** â†’ seats in rows & columns.
  - **Chess board / Tic-Tac-Toe game** â†’ positions on board.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Linked List
- **Singly Linked List**
  - Simple navigation like forward-only history.
- **Doubly Linked List**
  - **Music player playlist** â†’ next/previous song.
  - **Image viewer (slideshow)** â†’ next/previous image.
- **Circular Linked List**
  - **Round-robin scheduling in Operating System**.
  - Continuous looping in playlists.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stack (LIFO)
- **Browser history** â†’ back/forward navigation.
- **Undo/Redo in text editor**.
- **Function call/recursion stack** in Java memory.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Queue (FIFO)
- **Printer queue** â†’ first document printed first.
- **Customer service system** â†’ first come, first served.
- **Task scheduling in OS**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Priority Queue / Heap
- **Hospital emergency room** â†’ critical patients first.
- **CPU Job Scheduling** â†’ high-priority tasks executed first.
- **Google Maps shortest path (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)** â†’ Min-Heap.

---

## ðŸ“Œ HashMap / HashTable
- **Dictionary app** â†’ word lookup by key.
- **Database indexing** â†’ fast retrieval using keys.
- **Caching (YouTube, Netflix, etc.)** â†’ store metadata for quick access.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Graph
- **Google Maps / GPS navigation** â†’ locations as nodes, roads as edges.
- **Social media networks (Facebook, LinkedIn)** â†’ users as nodes, friendships as edges.
- **Airline routes** â†’ airports as nodes, flights as edges.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Trees
- **Binary Search**
  - Searching a contact in a sorted phonebook.
- **Binary Trees / B-Trees**
  - Database indexing.
- **File system hierarchy**
  - Folders and files represented as a tree.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Trie (Prefix Tree)
- **Google Search auto-suggestions**.
- **Spell checker in MS Word**.
