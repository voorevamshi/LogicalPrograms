It is architecture style where applicaton is built as a collection of small, autonomous services, 
each responsible for a specific business functionality.
each microservice should
Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Typically communicate over lightweight protocols

Key Components
API Gateway(Spring Cloud Gateway)
Service Registory & Discovery(Neflx Eureka)
Circuit Breaker(Resilience4j,Hystrix)
Load balancing
Configuration Management(Spring Cloud Config)
Centralized logging(E.g ELK stack)
Distributed Tracing(Zipkin, Jaeger)

-->Data management
each microservce own its own database


-->Deployment & Scaling
Horizontal scaling 


-->Security
Use API Gateway for authentication and authorization
Token based authenticaton (E.g JWT Oauth2)


-->Challanges
Distributed system complexity
Data consistency
Service orchestration
Debugging and monitoring
Deployment and versioning
